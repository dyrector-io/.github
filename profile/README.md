[dyrector.io](https://github.com/dyrector-io/dyrectorio) is an open-source deployment platform that helps software teams manage releases & deployments easily and efficiently. While non-specialists are enabled to manage these processes in a simplified, self-service manner, specialists can deploy and manage containerized apps faster through the platform.

- **Stakeholders** can deliver new functions and products with a higher velocity
- **CTOs & Technical Managers** can reduce time-to-market, manage cloud costs more efficiently and maintain team productivity.

## Benefits of Developer Platforms
Internal Developer Platforms, or IDPs were created to simplify the use of tools only specialists were able to manage. These abstractions brought a new interface of collaboration, a single source-of-truth between teams working on the same project. This made IDPs the ultimate tools of teams working under DevOps methodology.

They not only accelerate the software development lifecycle and certain areas of it, including local testing, IDPs are useful to avoid vendor lock-in.

### Get more things done with one tool

Platforms bring tools under the same hood. Teams using platforms no longer need to keep checking different tabs and terminals. Platforms make it convenient to access configuration management and monitoring tools. Role-based access control (RBAC) make sure your teammates have access to functions essential to them.
### Increased inter-team collaboration

App integrations enable platforms to send notifications of others' interactions and events occuring on your infrastructure to your team's communication channels. Teams and their members no longer need to reach out to each other, only in cases when it's really needed.

De-facto version management solutions like Git can be used at higher efficiency. Meaningful commit messages can be turned into automated changelogs with integrated tools like Conventional Commits.

### Self-service simplified

Abstractions save time for both non-specialists and specialists. For your specialist teammates, less cognitive effort will be required to get things done fast. When the specialists are busy, non-specialists have self-service access to tools & technologies.
