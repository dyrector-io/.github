[dyrector.io](https://github.com/dyrector-io/dyrectorio) is an open-source OCI container management platform that offers self-service Docker and Kubernetes deployment and configuration management capabilities to any cloud or on-premises infrastructure with a UI and an API.

## Who we are

We're a team of 7 based in a town around 90-mins south from Budapest, Hungary. We're passionate about technology and innovation. Part of the reason why we chose to create a platform that helps its users to quickly set their containerized applications up with whatever infrastructure they use.

The other reason is that the founders of the project, Levi and Berci worked for a different client back then. They needed a way for salespeople to self-service deployments to redistribute their software. They couldn't find a solution, so they decided to make one for this use case.

### Culture

Most of the team is still in their 20s, which allows us to spend some time outside of work connecting with each other after an exhausting day working on a new feature or to begin the day with breakfast at the office. While in-person availability isnâ€™t required, the team is still on-site 99% of the time. Itâ€™s just easier to communicate while everyoneâ€™s in town.

For remote conversations, we prefer to use Discord, and task management takes place on Jira.

We encourage proactivity and prompt solutions to emerging challenges. We believe that even if you canâ€™t do something about a problem, the least you can do is let others know so they can react to the problem. We believe that working out solutions together helps the team bond over hard times. Itâ€™s easier to do when the entire team takes ownership of the project.

We take time to celebrate success and pick each other up when things donâ€™t go our way. This means we celebrate things like birthdays, graduations, sports achievements like Lake Balaton Cross Swimming, marathons together, and speak our minds when someone needs to vent because theyâ€™re going through some personal things, or one of us made a mistake and they feel down about it.

### How we work

Our approach to getting things done mostly resembles agile/SCRUM methodology, but we donâ€™t live and die by it. We donâ€™t have sprints all the time, but when thereâ€™s a pile of things to get done, mainly shipping new features, we tend to focus more on the practice, having daily standups to maintain sync between teammates, and so on.

### Open-source

Our team consists of seven people, and although not all of them work on this project full-time, the majority do. We need to pay our engineers every month, and currently, we generate revenue by providing consultancy services. We are a fully independent team and do not have any investments. Our long-term goal is to work on this project full-time but to achieve this, we require funding.

Our plan is to make the full project available for free if you choose to self-host it, but we also want to create a SaaS model where users can pay based on their usage. We don't have a complete plan for this yet. At present, we enjoy working on this project, collecting feedback, and making improvements to it.

### Motivation behind starting this project

We were working on a totally different project that included self-service release management capabilities of containerized apps as a business requirement. Our client made a white labelled product that needed self-service deployments to redistribute the product. While Portainer and Yacht are amazing projects, we just couldn't find one serving our exact needs, so we decided to make our platform.

After a while, we noticed that this is a bit of a niche use case, so we tried to extend its capabilities into an Internal Developer Platform direction so that it can be valuable to a lot of users. On top of these, we decided to make it open source so users can take a better look at the project before introducing it into their infrastructure.
